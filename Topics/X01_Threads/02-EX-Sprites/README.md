# Sprites

## Hello World

  - Write a program to print "Hello" once a second from a new thread. 
  - Now change the print so that the "end" character is a space instead of a line feed.
  - Now make a second thread, prints "World" once a second.
  - Start the second thread one half second after the "Hello" thread. That way they the words are in order.
  - Can you change the wording to "Hello there world" using another thread?

## Sprites
  - Copy the `sprites.py` and `sprite_mover.py` files into your project.
  - Modify the `sprite_mover.py` to move a rectangle back and forth in a horizontal line.
  - Start another thread with a rectangle moving in a square around the screen.
  - Try other patterns: triangle? random?
  - Tinker with the `sprites.py` code. Can you fill the rectangles? Can you a "make" function for circles?
  - Have fun!
