# Test Cases for Tic Tac Toe Board

Write test cases for the TicTacToeBoard methods. Only THEN should you write the tests.

Start with the "Tinker" from the PPTX. Then move on to "get_status".

Maybe you can use some lists and helper methods to make win-checks easier? Something like:

```python
wins = [
  [0,3,1,4,5], # X wins
  [0,3,1,4,6,5], # O wins
  # others
]
```
