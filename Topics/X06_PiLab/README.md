## Roomba
Wire up three LEDs to the Rpi. Make a program to control this "red light":
  - 5 seconds green
  - 1 second yellow
  - 5 seconds red
  - Repeat
  
Move the roomba out 5 seconds and back 5 seconds. Did it return to the same spot? Run
your code a few times.

Move the roomba in a square. Does it return to the same spot every time?
