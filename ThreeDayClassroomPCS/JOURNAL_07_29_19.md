One topic per morning seems to be plenty with some short topics at the ends. The threading took all morning. Didn't get
to the sprites lab -- just the "Hello" and "World". Ended the morning with "lambdas". Student suggested tying slides 5
and 6 into an example (like the one mentioned above).

Test driven development and unit cases for the afternoon. I thought it was a good session. Then iterators and generators to wind up the day.
Generators needs work. More explanation of why generators are useful. Maybe  huge-list example or a socket-input example.

The "global" keyword is confusing. 

Make a note in the slide that the "with" for locks uses RLock. Maybe an example of why we need RLock.
