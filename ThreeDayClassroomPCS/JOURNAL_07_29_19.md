Wow. There is SO MUCH material listed as covering in day 2. I suspect the web module should move to day 3. Definitely 
shrink the depth of content on the DB and have an advanced deck ready just in case. SQL injection can be optional.

Really need to stick with PyCharm. Learn to use it FULLY to better demonstrate.

One topic per morning seems to be plenty with some short topics at the ends. The threading took all morning. Didn't get
to the sprites lab -- just the "Hello" and "World". Ended the morning with "lambdas". Student suggested tying slides 5
and 6 into an example (like the one mentioned above).

Test driven development and unit cases for the afternoon. I thought it was a good session. Then iterators and generators to wind up the day.
Generators needs work. More explanation of why generators are useful. Maybe  huge-list example or a socket-input example.

The "global" keyword is confusing. 

Make a note in the slide that the "with" for locks uses RLock. Maybe an example of why we need RLock.
