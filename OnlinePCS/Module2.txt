; Overview

    master
    reference

2 The values in a _____ key column must be unique.
     *primary

     constraint
     reference

3 Creating all combinations of rows from multiple tables is called a _____.
    *join
    query
    relationship
    ordering

; SQL Basics

5 Like in Java, SQL keywords are case sensitive.
    *FALSE

6 SQL commands must end with a _____.
    *semicolon
    period
    WHERE clause
    timeout

7 To create a table you use the SQL _____ command.
    *CREATE
    INSERT
    SCHEMA
    MAKE

8 To add rows to a table use the SQL _____ command.
    *INSERT
    ADD
    CREATE
    SET

9 To query rows from a table use the SQL _____ command.
    *SELECT
    GET
    FETCH
    READ

10 The asterisk wildcard following the SELECT command means:
    *SELECT all columns
    SELECT all rows
    SELECT all tables
    SELECT empty columns

11 To limit the rows the database returns use the SQL _____ clause.
    *WHERE
    SELECT
    wildcard
    MORE

12 The UPDATE command changes at most one row in the database.
    *FALSE ^ Be careful

13 Use the SQL _____ command to join multiple tables.
    *SELECT ^ list several tables separated by commas
    JOIN
    WHERE
    COMBO

14 The server will order the returned rows for you if you send the _____ command.
    *ORDER BY
    WHERE
    ASCEND
    SORTED

15 A _____ key is unique across all rows in a table.
    *PRIMARY
    FOREIGN
    VARCHAR
    ENUM

16 A _____ key references a primary key in another table.
    *FOREIGN
    PRIMARY
    VARCHAR
    REF

17 The SQLite database can generate primary keys for you.
    *TRUE

18 The SQLite database can enforce foreign key constraints.
    *TRUE ^ remember to turn on the checking

19 You can add a constraint to a column to ensure the value is greater than zero.
    *TRUE ^ like with "CHECK (grade>0)"

; Transactions 

20 When you are ready to commit your changes to the database send the _____ command.
    *commit
    flush
    write
    rollback

21 If you want to abort your changes to the database send the _____ command.
    *rollback
    abort
    commit
    rewind


; SQLInjection

; PythonDBAPI

22 Python ships with the database driver for _____ .
    *sqlite
    postgres
    oracle
    mysql

23 The SQL language is identical across all database implementations.
    *FALSE ^ the sql type "boolean", for instance, is not available in all

24 You must import _____ to talk to a sqlite database.
    *sqlite3
    dbapi
    sqldriver
    dbdriver

25 This method takes the filename of the sqlite database.
   *connect
   cursor
   fetchall
   execute

26 Once you are connected to the database you will need a _____ object to execute SQL statements.
   *cursor
   transaction
   injector
   statement

27 The "execute" method can send up to _____ SQL statements to the database at once.
   *one ^ each call to execute sends a single command to the database
   two
   as many as you want
   zero

28 Use the _____ method to fetch the next row from the cursor.
   *fetchone
   fetchmany
   fetchall
   getrow

29 Use the _____ method to fetch all remaining rows from the cursor.
   *fetchall
   getrows
   fetchmany
   fetchone

30 The _____ method takes the number of rows you want to fetch.
   *fetchmany
   fetchrows
   fetchall
   getrows

31 The Python DBAPI models a row from the database as a:
   *tuple
   list
   array
   object

32 Whenever possible you should pull the raw data from the database and write your calculations in Python.
   *FALSE ^ the database is exceedingly efficient at searches and ordering

33 Virus protection software protects your server from SQL injection attacks.
   *FALSE ^ SQL injection is a bug in your code

34 The Python DBAPI standardizes the "?" as the parameter substitution token.
   *FALSE ^ The "?" is just one of many schemes that vendors can choose

35 The following creates a tuple of one thing:
   *(name,)
   (name)
   ((name))
   tup(name)

36 When you are ready to apply all of the changes you made to the database you call:
   *commit
   rollback
   apply
   close

37 When you want to abort all of the changes you made to the database you call:
   *rollback
   commit
   apply
   drop

38 Your code should always call _____ on every database connection.
   *close
   rollback
   fetchall
   finally

39 By default, foreign-key-checking is turned on in sqlite3.
   * FALSE ^ Use the SQL "pragma foreign keys=ON" to enable it

40 SQLite keeps the database in a single file on the filesystem
   * TRUE
